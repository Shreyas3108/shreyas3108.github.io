		<h2> R - EDA projects </h2> 
		<h2> Exploratory data analytics using R on Baseball dataset </h2> 
        <p><em> <a href="http://shreyas3108.github.io/EDA-on-Pitch-data/greinke.html">You can check the detailed report out here!</a>.</em></p>

        <p>The Exploratory data analysis compare the famous pitcher Greinke's performance in the 2015 MLB season. The main aim was to check if Greinke did something different </br>
		during July 2015 when he was celebrated by the media personnel! </p>

        <h2>EDA - WineQuality data </h2> 
        <p><em><a href = "http://github.com/Shreyas3108/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Summary---R/"> The RMD file is available here the main aim was to check what are the factors which affects </br>
		the quality of red wine </a></em></p>

        <h2> Self Driving car projects</h2> 

        <h3> Term - 2 </h3>
        
		<h4> PID Controller </h4>
			<p>
			Creating a Proportional Inverse and Differential Controller for Self Driving car , The main aim of the project is to run the car at the center of the road throughout the simulation. 
			The project is a part of Udacity's Self Driving car nanodegree and basic execution and idea's can be found on 
			<a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/CarND-Term2-PID-Controller"> This link , on to the readme </a></p> 
		
		<h4> Kidnapped Vehicle Project </h4> 
		
		<p> In this project i have implemented a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide).
		At each time step the filter will get observation and control data. The basic idea is to run the particle filter for a certain time where it shows minimal error. 
		<a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/Kidnapped-Vehicle"> Here's the link to the code , More on readme! </a></p> 
		
		<h4> Kalman Filter's </h4> 
		<p>
			In a series of two project's 
			a. Extended Kalman Filter 
			b. Unscented Kalman Filter 
			
			The major aim of the project was to implement a Kalman Filter which would estimate state of moving objects by the help of RADAR and LIDAR measurements 
			
			<a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/CarND-Term2-Unscented-Kalman-Filter"> Here's the Link for Unscented Kalman Filter </a> 
			<br> 
			<a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/CarND-Term2-Extended-Kalman-Filter">Here's the Link for Extended Kalman Filter </a>

		<h3> Term - 1 </h3> 
		<p> The term - 1 emphasised more on Deep Learning and Computer Vision technology on a Self Driving car</p> 
		
		<h4> Vehicle Detection and Tracking </h4> 
		<p> In this wonderful project , I have used Deep Learning as well as traditional approach to identify and track vehicles on road using transformation such as HOG </br> 
		The project includes approaches on solving the problem of tracking a vehicle using Sliding window using OpenCV </p> 
		<a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/Vehicle-Detection-and-Tracking"> More can be found on readme of this repo </a> </p> 
		
		<h4> Lane Line Detection </h4> 
		
		In this two series project of detecting the lane lines on the road OpenCV has been used and lane lines have been detected. 
		
		Check out the two project's with it's description on the readme , 
		<a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/Advanced-Lane-Line-Detection"> Advanced-Lane-Line-Detection using Polynomial fitting </a> 
		<a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-P1-LaneDetection"> Lane Line detection of edges of the lane </a> 
		
		</p> 
		
		<h4> Behavioral Cloning </h4> 
		<p> 
		Making your car learn from it's master (You , Human). This project talks about how Uber is building Self Driving car using the Behavioral Cloning. 
		More can be found on the readme file of this <a href = "https://github.com/Shreyas3108/Behavioral-Cloning-P3-USDC"> This repository </a></p> 
		
		<h4> Traffic Sign Classifier </h4> 
		
		<p> It is super important that the self driving car knows what the signs mean ? Here We build a traffic sign classifier which would recognize the signboards using CNN </p>
